Prerequisites:
Journal Node roles should have separate disks to write.
Need additional 50 GB disks on the 3 mentioned hosts for JournalNode roles.

Downtime required: 1 hour 30 minutes

Plan Of Action:
Put Cluster and CMS Services under Maintenance mode
Go to the HDFS service.
Select Actions > Enable High Availability.
Accept the default name nameservice1 and click Continue.
In the NameNode Hosts field, click Select a host. The host selection dialog box displays.
Check the checkbox next to the IP-172-31-84-247 where the standby NameNode will be set up and click OK.
In the JournalNode Hosts field, click Select hosts. The host selection dialog box displays.
Check the check boxes next to an odd number of hosts (a minimum of three) to act as JournalNodes and click OK.
Specify hosts: ip-172-31-84-247, ip-172-31-84-23 and ip-172-31-84-22
Click Continue.
In the JournalNode Edits Directory property, enter directory location for the JournalNode edits directory into the fields for each JournalNode host as /dfs/jn
Keep it the same for all the hosts.
The directory owner should be hdfs:hadoop and must have read, write, and execute permission (drwx------).
Click continue and then Cloudera Manager will execute a set of commands that stop the dependent services, delete, create, and configure roles and directories as required, create a nameservice and failover controller, restart the dependent services, and deploy the new client configuration.
Exit maintenance for cluster and CMS service.
